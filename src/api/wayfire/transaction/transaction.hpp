/**
 * transaction_t represents a collection of changes to views' states which
 * are applied atomically. The individual changes are called instructions.
 *
 * The transaction lifetime is as follows:
 *
 * - NEW: transaction has been created, but not submitted to core. In this
 *   state, transactions can live indefinitely and have no effect whatsoever.
 *   Generally, a transaction should be submitted as soon as possible, to avoid
 *   the case where it contains a dangling view (this case causes a crash).
 *
 * - PENDING: transaction has been submitted to core via
 *   wf::compositor_core_t::submit().  Instructions are not yet sent to clients.
 *
 * - COMMITTED: instructions have been sent to client, and Wayfire is waiting
 *   for a response.
 *
 * Transactions are moved from PENDING to COMMITTED automatically.
 * This is possible as soon as there are no COMMITTED transactions which affect
 * the same views.  Otherwise, all PENDING transactions are merged together into
 * a single PENDING transaction.
 *
 * Destruction of transactions:
 *
 * - A pending or committed transaction may fail at any time, for ex. if a view
 *   in it is closed by the client.
 * - A committed transaction may time out because clients are too slow to
 *   respond.
 * - A committed transaction may succeed if all clients update their surfaces on
 *   time.
 *
 * In all of these three cases, 'done' signal is emitted from the transaction
 * manager, with information on why the transaction has ended.
